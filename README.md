## Business Need
Demand for tech talent is on the rise. Headhunters are increasingly using data-driven tools to find suitable candidates. These mostly consist of a search engine and cost several thousand dollars per year and license. The industry is looking for an affordable alternative.

## Approach
DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are the most cost-efficient business organizations of the 21st century. And they reward those who have actually contributed. 

In the course of this project, a DAO will be created that offers a tech talent platform for headhunters. Headhunters can view aggregated information about available talent via a dashboard, and search and contact suitable candidates.

Each member of the DAO receives shares for each contribution in the form of crypto tokens. Headhunters need cryptotokens to own the platform. This increases the price of the tokens and thus remunerates the members of the DAO.

The platform will be decentralized. Hosting takes place via IPFS and ENS on Ethereum. Data is also stored decentrally on IPFS. All costs will be covered via crowd funding through the sale of tokens.
